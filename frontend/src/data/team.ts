    bio: [
      "Andy has over ten years' experience working in the wine industry.",
      "His passion for wine really ignited when working for Corney & Barrow in London, after attending an in-house wine course. From there he moved to one of the longest standing wine companies on the high street - Oddbins - and completed WSET Levels 2 and 3.",
      "After many years at Oddbins he found a home at a small fine wine merchant called Philglas & Swiggot. It was there he worked with fellow Australian & Master of Wine - Justin Knock MW, and gained the highly valued WSET Diploma.",
      "Now back in Melbourne, Andy is currently a student on the Master of Wine program, and continues to work in the wine trade sharing his passion and love of wine with those keen to learn more."

    name: 'Melissa Mills',
    bio: [
      "Melissa Mills's sake journey began with a fascination for Japanese culture, language and cuisine but it was one snowy winter's day in Gifu prefecture's sleepy Mizunami village when passion turned to dedication.",
      "Standing in the aromatic warmth of a cedar clad Koji room, in the eaves of 300-year-old Nakashima Sake Brewery, she was offered a handful of rice, covered in silky tendrils of white mold, and invited to eat. Struck with a sudden thirst for deeper understanding Melissa continued exploring Japan and sake whilst intensively studying the language. In 2016 she formalised her relationship with sake by completing WSET level 3 sake qualifications.",
      "After winning The International Wine Challenge Award in Sake in 2017 Melissa attended London's WSET Global Graduation and Awards Ceremony receiving the prize of participating on the judging team at the 2018 International Wine Challenge Sake Competition held in Yamagata Prefecture, Japan."

    name: 'Joanne Winterbottom',
    role: 'DipWSET',
    bio: [
      "Joanne grew up in the Yarra Valley, where family connections established some of Australia's revered wineries, and she became aware of the magic of wine at an early age.",
      "A journalist by training, she worked in print and broadcast media and held media advisory and management roles in government and private industry before moving to the Mornington Peninsula to raise her children. It was here, where generations of her family have fished the waters of Port Phillip and Westernport, that Joanne was drawn to the vibrant local wine industry.",
      "Having worked in cellar door sales and wine marketing, administration and production, she has a comprehensive understanding of the industry from vineyard to market.",
      "Having earned the Wine and Spirit Education Trust Diploma in 2018, Joanne completed the WSET educator training program in Hong Kong later that year.",
      "She reckons there is no such thing as a silly question, except perhaps, 'What's your favourite wine?', because how can you choose one from a world of delicious alternatives?"

    name: 'David Garvie',
    bio: [
      "Having enjoyed coaching tennis to get through university, and 30 years in industry, Dave was looking for a new challenge that coupled his passion for teaching and science.",
      "Over a glass of wine one evening, Dave decided wine education ticked both boxes. 'Science has the ability to demystify the complicated, and WSET courses demystified wine in a way that maximised my enjoyment for what's in the glass. I'd like to bring that to others'.",
      "Dave studied at Melbourne Wine School and completed WSET 1, 2 and 3 with distinction, under the expert guidance of Andy McIntyre.",
      "Dave is always super keen to meet and develop beginners, enthusiasts and those employed, or seeking employment, within the wine industry. For the last two years Dave could also be found working as a cellar door specialist at a small family owned vineyard - Pimpernel in the Yarra Valley."

      "Maddy has over 10 years' experience working with wine, spanning different sectors, countries and cultures.",
      "She grew up around the industry and discovered her interest in wine while working for her family's business: Pimpernel Vineyards, a boutique producer of Yarra Valley wines.
